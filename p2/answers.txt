Note: fibonacci.c with 21 iterations

a) Cycles per second for TLM : 3082482/04.35 = 708616.5517
    
   Cycles per second for Verilog simulation 25455.2272

   Speedup from the TLM model = 708616.5517/25455.2272 => 21.84

   => TLM is ~22X faster than the verilog model

c) CPI for TLM : 3082482/531990 = 5.7942

   CPI for Verilog simulation = 2.6133

  (The value of CPI is more than what was expected )
